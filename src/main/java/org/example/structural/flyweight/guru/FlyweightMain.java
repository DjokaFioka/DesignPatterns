/**
 Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM
 by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
 In this example, we’re going to render a forest (1.000.000 trees)!
 Each tree will be represented by its own object that has some state (coordinates, texture and so on).
 Although the program does its primary job, naturally, it consumes a lot of RAM.
 The reason is simple: too many tree objects contain duplicate data (name, texture, color).
 That’s why we can apply the Flyweight pattern and store these values inside separate flyweight objects (the TreeType class).
 Now, instead of storing the same data in thousands of Tree objects, we’re going to reference one of the flyweight objects with a particular set of values.
